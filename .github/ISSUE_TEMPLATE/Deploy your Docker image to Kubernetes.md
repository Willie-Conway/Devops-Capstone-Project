## **Feature Description:**

**Feature**: Deploy Customer Accounts Microservice to Kubernetes

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I need** to deploy the Docker container of the customer accounts microservice to Kubernetes  
**So that** the service can be scaled and managed in a cloud-native environment.

<br><br>

## **Details and Assumptions:**

- Kubernetes cluster is set up for deployment.  
- The Docker image is pushed to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).  
- Kubernetes deployment files (e.g., deployment.yaml) are created for the service.

<br><br>

## **Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Given that the Docker image is ready and pushed to the container registry  
When I deploy the Docker image to Kubernetes  
Then the service should be deployed successfully  
And the application should be accessible via the exposed endpoint
```
