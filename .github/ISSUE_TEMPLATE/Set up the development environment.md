## **Feature Description:**

**Feature**: Development Environment Setup

**As a** developer  
**I need** to set up a local development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies  
**So that** I can begin developing the customer accounts microservice.

<br><br>

## **Details and Assumptions:**

- All required development tools (Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) should be installed.  
- The environment must be able to build and run the microservice locally.  
- Dependencies should be documented in the project repository.

<br><br>

## **Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Given that I have installed all required development tools  
When I run the environment setup script  
Then I should be able to successfully build and run the application  
And the required dependencies should be correctly installed
```
