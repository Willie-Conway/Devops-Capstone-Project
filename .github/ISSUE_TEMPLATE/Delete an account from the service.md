## **Feature Description:**

**Feature**: Delete Customer Account

**As a** customer service agent  
**I need** to be able to delete a customer account from the service  
**So that** I can remove invalid or unnecessary accounts.

<br><br>

## **Details and Assumptions:**

- Deleting an account removes it permanently from the system.  
- Only authorized users should be able to delete accounts.  
- A success message should be returned after deletion.

<br><br>

## **Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Given that a customer account exists with a valid customer ID  
When I delete the customer account  
Then the system should remove the account from the database  
And return a "200 OK" response confirming the deletion
```
