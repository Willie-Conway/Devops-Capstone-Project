## **Feature Description:**

**Feature**: List Customer Accounts

**As a** customer service agent  
**I need** to retrieve and list all customer accounts from the service  
**So that** I can view a complete list of customers.

<br><br>

## **Details and Assumptions:**

- The list should be paginated for efficiency.  
- The service must return essential details such as the customer ID, name, and email.  
- Only authorized personnel should have access to list all accounts.

<br><br>

## **Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Given that there are multiple customer accounts in the system  
When I request the list of all customer accounts  
Then the system should return a paginated list of accounts  
And the status code should be "200 OK"
```
