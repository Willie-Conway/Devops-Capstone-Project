# 📅 Lab 1: Agile Planning Using GitHub

Welcome to the **Agile Planning** lab! In this exercise, you’ll learn how to use GitHub’s Agile tools — Issues, Labels, Milestones, and Projects — to plan and track your work effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Create GitHub Issues to track user stories and tasks
* Use Labels to categorize and prioritize work
* Group Issues into Milestones for release planning
* Use GitHub Projects (Kanban boards) to manage workflow visually
* Move stories across columns to reflect progress

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* Basic familiarity with GitHub repositories and issues

---

## 📝 Step 1: Create Issues for User Stories

1. Go to your GitHub repository’s **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New issue**.
3. Enter the title and description for a user story or task.
4. Submit the issue.

💡 *Tip:* Use clear, actionable titles and detailed descriptions for each issue.

---

## 🏷️ Step 2: Add Labels

* Create and assign labels like:

  * `story` (for user stories)
  * `bug`
  * `enhancement`
  * `priority: high` / `priority: low`

* To add labels:

  * Click on an issue
  * Select **Labels** on the right sidebar
  * Choose or create the appropriate label

---

## 🎯 Step 3: Create Milestones

* Navigate to the **Milestones** tab under Issues.
* Create a milestone representing a release or sprint (e.g., `Sprint 1`, `Release 1.0`).
* Assign issues to this milestone to track their progress towards completion.

---

## 📊 Step 4: Create and Use a Project (Kanban Board)

1. Go to the **Projects** tab.
2. Create a new project using the **Kanban (Basic)** template.
3. Set up columns such as:

   * To Do
   * In Progress
   * Done
4. Add your issues as cards to the project board.
5. Drag and drop issues between columns as work progresses.

---

## 🔄 Step 5: Track and Update

* Regularly update issue status by moving cards across the board.
* Close issues when done.
* Update milestones to reflect sprint or release progress.

---

## ✅ Evidence

* Take a screenshot of your GitHub Project board showing issues in different columns.
* Save it as `agile-planning-kanban.png`.

---

## 💡 Tips for Effective Agile Planning

* Keep issues small and manageable.
* Prioritize stories clearly using labels and milestones.
* Use the project board daily to reflect current progress.
* Link pull requests to issues for traceability.

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You’ve successfully set up an Agile planning workflow using GitHub’s built-in tools. This will help your team stay organized and focused on delivering value incrementally.
